# CI/CD Pipeline Demo Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** and **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**. It automates building, testing, and deploying a Python **Flask application**, showcasing cloud deployment and continuous integration practices.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Python Flask Application
- Developed a Flask backend application (`app.py`) to simulate a web service.
- Handles HTTP requests and responses as part of the demo.

### 2. Git & GitHub Setup
- Initialized a Git repository locally and pushed the code to GitHub.
- Resolved merge conflicts and synced with the remote repository.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Configured `.github/workflows/ci-cd-demo.yml` to:
  - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Run automated tests.
  - Deploy the application to AWS after successful tests.
- Verified workflow execution directly in the GitHub Actions tab.

### 4. AWS Deployment
- Configured AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment to host the Flask application.
- Linked GitHub Actions workflow to deploy automatically on each push to `main`.
- Verified the live deployment.
